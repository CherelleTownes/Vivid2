<h2>MVP</h2>
Minimum Goals - Create 6 components, place proper routes, and utilize Storybook to create 5 reuseable components. Need to have features: the ability for people to select a button with a choice if they like the task or do not like the task and wish to have a different suggestion. 

<h2>Post-MVP</h2>
Nice to have features - A graph or some type of fun feature showing how many people actually completed the tasks given to them so it can encourage others to complete the task. The option the user select to have a funny joke told to them if they do not wish to complete the task.
